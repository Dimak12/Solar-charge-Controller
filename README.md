# Solar-charge-Controller
A system that uses solar energy to charge a battery that in turn powers a load.
The arduino uno microcontroller sends a pwm signal based on an algorithm used to control the charging of the battery to avoid overcharging or discharge. 
Charging stops at 14.4V and is kept at approximately 14.4V.
The system consists of Arduino Uno microcontroller, Solar panel, Battery, LCD and other components.
